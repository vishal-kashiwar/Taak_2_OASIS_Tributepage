            <h3>Indian Cricketer (Batsman)</h3>
            <p>
                A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after leading India to glory in the Under-19
                World Cup at Kuala Lumpur in early 2008.
                In an Indian team filled with saint-like icons worthy of their own hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his
                most un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast.</p><br>
            <p>
                <b>1.Full name:</b> Virat Kohli<br>
                <b>2.Born:</b>Nov 05, 1988 (34 years) ,Delhi, India<br>
                <b>3.Batting:</b>Right-handed<br>
                <b>4.Bowling:</b>Right-arm medium<br>
                <b>5.Role:</b>Opening batter<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Early and personal life:</h4>
            <p> Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi to a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Kohli,
                worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother,
                Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.<br>
                Kohli's formative years were spent in the Uttam Nagar and commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti
                Public School.<br>
                According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a mere three-year-old. He
                would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him.<br>
            </p><br>

            <h4>Domestic career:</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Grind through the ranks</b><br>

                <b> &gt;</b> soon joined the senior Men in Blue in Sri Lanka, come August 2008. In the absence of the
                regular openers, Virat Kohli was given a chance to open the batting in the ODI series. He played some
                commendable knocks in his extended run as an opener, as India went on to win the ODI series. However,
                the established and formidable pair of Tendulkar and Sehwag kept Kohli out of the team<br>
                <b> &gt; </b> The 20-year-old continued to impress for Delhi and dominated attacks, clearly demonstrating
                that he belonged at a much higher level; that junior cricket was beneath his standards. Kohli then
                traveled to Australia in 2009 for the Emerging players tournament and stamped his authority all over the
                bowling attacks.<br>
                <b> &gt; </b> He added 'big-match temperament' to his résumé too, lacing a fluent hundred in the final
                against South Africa, and guiding his team to a clinical victory. <br>
                <b> &gt; </b> The young prodigy, barely old enough to receive his man-of-the-match champagne, ended the
                tournament with 398 runs from 7 outings with two centuries and two fifties, ensuring that he remained
                fresh in the selectors' minds<br>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>International career:</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Cementing a national spot</b><br>

                <b> &gt; </b> The selectors had no choice but to give Kohli another go in the Indian side, and this time he
                strung together a number of impressive scores. After being given an extended run, he repaid their faith
                by notching up his maiden ODI hundred in an impressive run-chase against Sri Lanka in December 2009 -
                his first of many exemplary knocks in run-chases.<br>
                <b> &gt; </b> In the World Cup final of 2011, the biggest stage of
                them all, Kohli, along with his Delhi teammate Gautam Gambhir, pulled off a largely underrated rescue
                effort with an 83-run stand after losing the openers early. This knock played a crucial role in setting
                the platform for MS Dhoni's fabled knock of 91*, which eventually won India the World Cup on that
                enchanting evening in Mumbai.<br>

                <b> &gt; </b> In the hangover of the World Cup euphoria, Kohli continued to take giant strides in the
                limited-overs format. Three years after his ODI debut, he was finally handed the coveted Test cap in the
                Caribbean islands in July 2011, owing to the need to rest the senior players.<br>
                <b> &gt; </b> After a series each against the Dukes ball and the SG ball, it was now time for his trial
                against the Kookaburra Down Under.In the first two Tests, he seemed to lack the technique to play in
                Australia, maintaining his low stance on the bouncy tracks. He also had a rather restricting trigger
                movement with his front-foot routinely coming across towards off-stump, thereby hindering the necessary
                movement to play back-foot shots such as the pull and the cut<br>

            </p><br>
            <h4>International career:</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Captaincy and a change in technique</b><br>

                - With regular captain MS Dhoni ailing from an injury, Kohli was named stand-in captain for the first
                Test at Adelaide. After an abysmal tour of England, critics were sceptical of Kohli's performance in
                Australia in the Border-Gavaskar trophy in December. Kohli proved that they couldn't have been more
                wrong, as he scored two fluent hundreds in the first Test at Adelaide. His second innings masterclass of
                141 almost pulled off a stunning run-chase on a notorious 5th day rank-turner, and went on to score a
                total of four hundreds on this tour. Saying that he had silenced critics would be an understatement.<br>

                - As India prepared for their title defence ahead of the 2015 World Cup Down Under, with the catch
                phrase 'Won't give it back' doing the rounds, Virat Kohli was touted to be a key performer for India.
                The Indians had a terrible run in Australia, having failed to win a single match in the Test series as
                well as the succeeding ODI tri-series. Kohli started off in signature fashion, with a typically
                stroke-filled hundred against Pakistan as India maintained their unbeaten run against their arch-rivals
                in ICC events.<br>

                - As India stormed into the semi-finals unbeaten, Kohli's form continued to take an
                uncharacteristic dip, culminating in a painstaking 1 in the semi-final loss against the co-hosts and
                eventual champions, Australia.<br>

                - Kohli, the then full-time Test captain, toured Sri Lanka with a young side without the services of
                Mahendra Singh Dhoni, wary of the Sri Lankan spinners' fabled 4th innings con-job. After losing the
                first Test, Kohli's India recorded a dramatic come-from-behind win in the series, going on to win
                2-1.<br>
                - Kohli continued to build on his auspicious start to Test captaincy as he led them to a rout of the
                South
                Africans on a series of rank-turners all around India. He had a quiet series with the bat, as the more
                stoic batsmen of his team took over. Nonetheless, the triumph took India to the No. 1 spot in the ICC
                Test rankings for the first time since they forfeited it to England after the forgettable white-wash in
                2011.<br>

                - He continued his emphatic run in T20 cricket (and running) like a man possessed though, thrashing
                boundaries with ridiculous ease. Despite an 89* in the 2016 semi-final against the West Indies
                (extending his inhuman run of form in the format), India's bowling panicked at a crucial stage. One had
                to feel sorry for him as he had to make do with the 'Player of the tournament' award for the second
                successive Twenty20 World Cup; a distinction he would've gladly exchanged for the elusive World T20
                trophy. <br>
                - Kohli's thirst for runs showed no signs of slowing down as he looted a small matter of 973 runs
                during the 2016 edition of the Indian Premier League, the most (by far) by any batsman in the history of
                the tournament - as he led his Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) franchise to a runners-up finish.<br>

                - However, it isn't beyond Kohli to prove his critics wrong yet again, as he continues to take criticism
                on his stride, setting new standards for modern batsmanship. And as a captain, he had his ups and downs,
                marred with a bit of controversy towards the end of his tenure. Kohli also became the first Indian, as
                well as the first Asian captain, to return victorious from Down Under when India won the 4-match Test
                series 2-1 (2018-19). Under Kohli, India also emerged as the number one Test side for five successive
                years (2016-2021).

            <h4>IPL</h4>
            <p>
                <b>IPL through the years</b><br>

                <b> &gt; </b>Ahead of the 2019 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), Virat Kohli showed how much
                faith he had in the franchise by declaring that he would perhaps end his career with the Bangalore-based
                Royal Challengers. The only player to be a part of a single franchise for the entire duration of the
                tournament (right from the start of the cash-rich league in 2008), Kohli has developed an affection with
                the franchise and with the fans over the period of time.<br>

                <b> &gt; </b>Having been brought into the franchise as a young emerging player in 2008, Kohli's growth has
                been stupendous. He learnt under the wings of Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble, before finally establishing
                himself under Daniel Vettori. It wasn't a free-flowing start, in a team that was struggling to find the
                essence of the tournament, it wasn't a surprise that they had a struggling youngster in the midst.
                Having learnt the ropes in the first three-year cycle, it wasn't a surprise that he was the only player
                retained in 2011. The purple patch began somewhere around that region, he then proved it wasn't just a
                purple patch, it was a career that was beginning to flourish. Soon after, Kohli became the best in all
                aspects, not just white-ball cricket, but in the red-ball version as well.<br>

                <b> &gt; </b>It became a no-brainer when he was asked to captain the Bangalore franchise on a permanent
                basis from 2012 and it also translated into more consistency with the bat. Kohli soon turned into a fan
                favourite even as runs flowed from his bat and eventually becoming the leading-run scorer in the history
                of IPL. Circa, 2016 - the India and RCB captain blasted 973 runs - the most by any player in the history
                of the game and it included four hundreds - the most by a batsman in a single edition. Alas, all this
                didn't translate into a title triumph - one that has kept Kohli and Bangalore waiting so far (As of
                March 2023).<br>
